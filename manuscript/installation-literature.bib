	abstract = {With single elements weighing up to hundreds of tonnes and lifted to heights of 100 meters, off shore wind turbines can pose risks to personnel, assets, and the environment during installation and maintenance interventions. To increase safety during off shore lifts, this study focuses on solutions for human-free lifting operations. Ideas in the categories of logistics, connections, as well as guidance and control, were discussed and ranked by means of a multi-criteria decision analysis. Based upon 38 survey responses weighting 21 predefined decision criteria, the most promising concepts were selected. Logistically, pre-assembled systems would reduce the number of lifts and thus reduce the risk. A MATLAB-based code has been developed to optimise installation time, lifted weight, and number of lifts. Automated bolting and seafastening solutions have high potential to increase safety during the transport of the wind turbine elements and, additionally, speed up the process. Finally, the wind turbine should be lifted on top of the support structure without having personnel being under the load. A multidirectional mechanical guiding element has been designed and tested successfully in combination with visual guidance by cameras in a small-scale experiment.},

Dampers are installed at the bottom to act on the curvature of the tower, and it is shown that dampers installed in suitable braces have the potential to increase the critical damping ratio of the two lowest tower modes by 1 percent. By using a toggle-brace system, damper stroke is increased, while the damper force is reduced. Finally, by installing the dampers in a symmetric configuration, tuning for maximum damping is approximately independent of the orientation of the rotor, thereby making this installation of dampers feasible.

In this research a method is presented to reduce the azimuthal orientation error of wind direction sensors by means of Doppler Lidar measurements. The method is based on the comparison between the conventional sensor and a distant long range lidar pointing to it in staring mode. By comparing their line-of-sight wind speeds any misalignment between both systems can be estimated more accurately. This method was applied in an measurement campaign in the offshore wind farm alpha ventus next to the meteorological mast FINO1. The maximum alignment error of a Sonic was reduced to below +/- 1 degrees. This accurate alignment has asserted, that no bias exists between Lidar and Sonic wind speed measurements.},

An alternative to the traditional joint is a steel-to-steel connection also called a slip joint. To ensure a proper fit of the slip joint a dynamic installation of the joint is proposed. In this contribution, the effectiveness of harmonic excitation as an installation procedure is experimentally investigated using a 1:10 scaled model of the joint. During the dynamic installation test the applied static load, settlements and dynamic response of the joint are monitored using respectively load cells, taut wires and strain gauges placed both inside and outside the conical surfaces. The results show that settlement occurs only when applying a harmonic load at specific forcing frequencies. The settlement stabilizes to a certain level for each of the specific frequencies, indicating that a controlled way of installation is possible. The results show that it is essential to vibrate at specific frequencies and that a larger amplitude of the harmonic force does not automatically lead to additional settlement.},

	abstract = {Costs of operation \& maintenance, assembly, transport and installation of offshore wind turbines contribute significantly to the total cost of offshore wind farm. These operations are mostly carried out by specific ships that have to be hired for the operational phase and for duration of installation process, respectively. Duration, and therefore ship hiring costs is, among others, driven by waiting time for weather windows for weather-sensitive operations. Today, state of the art decision making criteria for weather-sensitive operations are restrictions to the significant wave height and the average wind velocity at reference height. However, actual limitations are physical, related to response of equipment used e.g. crane wire tension, rotor assembly motions while lifting, etc. Transition from weather condition limits to limits on physical equipment response in decision making would improve weather window predictions, potentially reducing cost of offshore wind energy. This paper presents a novel approach to weather window estimation using ensemble weather forecasts and statistical analysis of simulated installation equipment response. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In the present work, the performance of the crossflow principle is assessed on the DTU 10MW reference blade using extensive 3D CFD calculations. Analysis of the computational results shows that there is only a relatively narrow region in which the crossflow principle describes the aerodynamic loading well. In some conditions the deviation of the predicted loadings can be quite significant, having a large influence on for instance the integral aerodynamic moments around the blade centre of mass; which is very important for single blade installation applications. The main features of these deviations, however, have a systematic behaviour on all force components, which in this paper is employed to formulate the first version of an engineering correction method to the crossflow principle applicable for wind turbine blades. The new correction model improves the agreement with CFD results for the key aerodynamic loads in crossflow situations. The general validity of this model for other blade shapes should be investigated in subsequent works.},

A simple engineering model is formulated to describe the aerodynamic forcing on the blade subject to turbulent wind of arbitrary direction. The model is coupled with a schematic aeroelastic representation of the taglines system, which returns the minimum line tension required to compensate for the aerodynamic forcing. The simplified models are in excellent agreement with the aeroelastic code HAWC2, and provide a solid basis for future design of an upgraded single blade installation system able to operate at higher wind speeds.},

To predict long-term metocean condition, a statistical analysis for different properties of wind and wave loading such as, windwave misalignment, significant wave height and wind velocity is carried out. The aerodynamic wind loading is calculated using the blade element method and the wave loading is computed using the JONSWAP wave spectrum and Morison equation. Dual linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) deployed in the side-side and fore-aft directions are used for comparison. The NREL monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine is used to examine the performance of 3d-PTMD in a realistic metocean condition. The fatigue damage is estimated based on the rain-flow cycle counting method and Miner’s rule. Results indicate that the 3d-PTMD can increase the wind turbine tower fatigue life by more than 50\% in comparison with the dual TMDs.},

	abstract = {Installation of wind-turbine blades on monopile-type offshore wind turbines is a demanding task. Typically, a jack-up crane vessel is used, and blades are individually lifted from the vessel deck and docked with the preinstalled hub. During the process of mating, large relative motions are developed between the hub and root due to combined effects of wind-generated blade-root responses and wave-generated monopile vibrations. This can cause impact loads at the blade root and induce severe damages at the blade-root connection. Such events are highly likely to cause the failure of the mating task, while affecting the subsequent activities, and thus require competent planning. The purpose of this paper is to present a probabilistic response-based methodology for estimating the allowable sea states for planning a wind-turbine blade-mating task, considering impact risks with the hub as the hazardous event. A case study is presented where the installation system consisting of blade-lift and monopile system are modelled using multibody formulations. Time-domain analyses are carried out for various sea states, and impact velocities between root and hub are analyzed. Finally, an extreme value analysis using the Gumbel fitting of response parameters is performed and limiting sea state curves are obtained by comparing characteristic extreme responses with allowable values. It is found that the limiting sea states for blade-root mating tasks are low for aligned wind-wave conditions, and further increase with increased wind-wave misalignment. The results of the study also show that the parameter {\textgreater} is essential for estimating limiting sea states given that this parameter significantly influences monopile vibrations during the blade-root mating task. Overall, the findings of the study can be used for a safer and more cost-effective mating of wind-turbine blades.},

Such situations can, in practice, occur for onshore and especially offshore wind turbines and are attributed to aging, turbine installation, scour or marine sand dunes phenomena and biofouling. Practical experience of wind turbine manufacturing industry has shown that such effects are most easily quantified in terms of the first natural frequency of the turbine support structure. The paper brings forward a study regarding the amount to which nominal tower damping controller performance is affected by changes in the turbine natural frequency. Subsequently, an adaptive tower damping control loop is designed using linear parameter-varying control synthesis; the proposed tower damping controller depends on this varying parameter which is assumed throughout the study to be readily available. An investigation of the fatigue load reduction performance in comparison with the original tower damping control approach is given for a generic three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine.

	abstract = {Offshore wind farm installation planning is highly complex, due to the high dependency on weather and the oversized components that impose speciﬁc constraints in areas such as transportation and lifting. Currently, there is very little transparency vis-à-vis the logistics challenges in the industry. We extend the literature by creating an overall view of the coherency between logistical methods and project performance. We develop knowledge about how to use the various approaches by analyzing different logistical solutions. A holistic view of the coherency between the approaches in terms of logistics and project performance, taking into consideration the external inﬂuence of weather, is provided through analysis of actual projects in the North Sea region. Case study ﬁndings reveal the major factors to be pre-assembly, vessel load, and the distance to shore. We suggest a pre-assembly strategy comprised of a minimum number of components for installation onsite and a maximum number of turbines to be loaded on a vessel. These ﬁndings are especially important for the new wind farms being positioned further offshore. We show by means of a case study, with speciﬁc characteristics and weather conditions, that the appropriate strategies can be arrived at by using a simulation-based decision-support tool we developed.},

	abstract = {Marine operations play a pivotal role throughout all phases of a wind farm’s life cycle. In particular uncertainties associated with offshore installations can extend construction schedules and increase the capital expenditure (CAPEX) required for a given project. Installation costs typically account for approximately 30\% of the overall project cost. This study considers the installation modelling for UK offshore Wind Rounds 1 and 2 using probabilistic simulation tool. The tool is used to output time-domain predictions for the completion of key installation phases. By varying key wind farm characteristics such as distance to shore and the number of turbines, an assessment of vessel performance was completed for each round by reviewing recorded durations predicted by the software. The results provide a quantiﬁcation of installation vessel performance and the associated deviations present a measure of installation risk. It is identiﬁed that the Round 1 vessels experience less weather downtime but higher variability and the Round 2 vessels perform more consistently but experience larger delays. The paper provides a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks, to support developers and project planners.},

	abstract = {Single blade installation is a method for installing wind turbine blades. If a jack-up vessel is used during an o shore installation, the wind turbine blade is mainly subjected to wind loads and experiences resonant motions, and the monopile is subjected to wave-induced vibrations. The blade mating process can be challenging if large relative motions occur between the blade root and the monopile top. This study numerically models a blade installation system that consists of a pre-installed monopile and nacelle assembly, and a 5 MW blade with tugger lines. By analyzing the blade-root and the hub motion radii from time-domain simulations, we evaluate the effects of mean wind speed, wind turbulence, significant wave height, wave spectrum peak period, wind-wave misalignment, and water depth on the blade installation. For the alignment phase, the blade-root motion is critical, especially when the mean wind speed and turbulence are high. The hub motion can be important when the monopile resonant responses are prominent. The relative in-plane motions rather than the hub or the blade motion alone should be considered during the assessment. For the mating phase, the high-frequency components of the responses are important in general. Because of the dominant flange-hole motions at the monopile top, an increase in water depth reduces the success rate of mating.},

	abstract = {Overview This repository contains data from an offshore measurement campaign conducted during the installation of the offshore wind farm trianel wind farm borkum II (https://www.trianel-borkumzwei.de/). The wind farm consists of 32 Senvion 6XM152 turbines. The installation took place between August 2019 and May 2020. An offshore wind turbine undergoing installation is interesting from a research point of view for several reasons: Simple geometry: turbine foundation and tower are both rotationally symmetric steel tubes. Rotational symmetry also leads to (approximate) isotrope structural characteristics in the plane normal to tower and foundation. High Reynolds number flow: Assuming a tower diameter of 6 m, and average wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 12 m/s under installation conditions, Reynolds numbers range from 4.5 million to 10.5 million. Wave loading und full scale conditions. Practical relevance to improving the competability of offshore wind. For fluid mechanics, closely monitoring offshore wind turbines under wind and wave loading thus compares to a full scale experiment. Monitoring 32 turbines undergoing installation thus enables the measurement a broad spectrum of different states. The investigation into the data is ongoing, questions and contributions are welcome. The current data release still does not include all data. The dataset will thus be updated again in the future with more data to come. First analytic results can be found here: Sander, A, Haselsteiner, AF, Barat, K, Janssen, M, Oelker, S, Ohlendorf, J, \& Thoben, K.

Both wind and wave loads are stochastic and are described using statistical models. Wave loads are a function of the sea state. For a sea states, the most important parameters are significant wave heigh H\_m0 and Wave peak period T\_P. To a lesser extend, wave direction, zero upcrossing period and maximum wave height are also important. Different statistical models can be used to describe the sea state and the relationship between significant wave heigh H\_m0 and wave peak period. Most prominent in the North Sea is the JONSWAP spectrum. Wind loads are depending on wind speed, wind direction, shear factor and turbulence intensity. Different statistical models are available to describe the wind spectrum. Wind and wave loads trigger a structural response of the turbine. The structural response depends on the loading spectrum as well as the transfer function. Furthermore the structural response is strongly depending on damping and elasticity of the structure. In turbines, damping is typically very low ({\textasciitilde} 0.5 - 1.5 \%). The response is dominated by the first Eigenfrequency of the turbine. As the turbine is assumed to be rotationally symmetric, the fore-aft and side-side mode are extremely close together if not indistinguishable [1]. The response has the characteristics of a narrow-band random vibration. A narrow-band random vibration is characterized by being dominated by a single, narrow frequency peak (here: first Eigenfrequency). The amplitude envelope follows a Rayleigh distribution and the phase angle is equally distributed between 0 and 2 pi. If viewed from above, the structural response describes a closed curve (orbit) which can be characterized by it shape (eccentricity), mean amplitude and direction. Mathematically speaking, this is a lissajous-figure, where the time series from one response direction is plotted as a function of the time series of the second response direction. [1]: under installation condition Experimental Setup Several locations were used to record data during the installation of the wind farm. They are listed in the following table: helihoist-\{1,2\}: data recorded from the helicopter hoisting platform atop the turbine nacelle. For most installations, two sensor boxes were deployed to ensure data availability. tp: Measurements from the transition piece sbitroot: Measurements from the blade lifting yoke's blade root side. The Z-axis is aligned to the blade main axis, X-Axis is perpendicular. sbittip: Measurements from the tip side of the blade lifting yoke. Z-axis aligned with the blade main axis, X-axis perpendicular damper: Measurements from the tuned mass damper used during single blade installation towertop: measurements from inside the turbine tower at the upper lift plattform towertransfer: measurements from atop the towers during sail out from the base harbour to the installation site  Organization of data For each turbine installation, a separate folder can be found, e.g. turbine-01 for the first and turbine-16 for the 16th turbine. Turbine numbering follows the order of installation. Different data sources are organized in subfolders for each turbine dataset. Unfortunately, not every data source is available for each turbine. Data sources are roughly sorted into categories. The following table lists these categories: location / tom : data from custom build sensor boxes. Data includes acceleration, angular acceleration, magnetic field, gnss recording and rough estimates of the eulerian angles. waves / wmb-sued : Sea state statistics for the installatin period of the turbine. waves / fino : Sea state statistics from the german research platform FINO1 located approx. 6 km from the installation site. waves / waveradar : Sea state statstics, recorded by a wave rider wave laser.  wind / lidar : high fidelity wind data recorded on the installation vessel during the installation of the wind farm. wind / scada : 10 min. mean wind statistisc recorded on wind turbines in the vicinity of the installation site. This data is used in case no LIDAR data is available. wind / anemometer : During some of the installations, anemometers were present on the installation vessel. These recordings are sorted into this sub-subfolder. wind / fino : Additonal wind statistics recorded by the FINO research station. Least recommended for investigations, as these recordings were taken approx. 6 km from the installation site. The zenodo data set includes 16 zip archives (for 16 turbines) as well as one zip archive including environmental data.

These Sensor Boxes were initially designed to measure accelerations and GPS tracks of offshore wind turbine towers undergoing installation. During the installation of the wind farm Trianel Windpark Borkum II they were subsequentially used to track the complete installation with a focus on single blade installation Data from the TOM devices comes as CSV files. The firmware of the boxes was designed, such that data was written into 10 MB sized txt files instead of one large txt file in order to circumvent data corruption due to power loss. However, this leads to a few milliseconds of missing data between log files. Additionally, jitter due to IO-Operations is present in the data as well and data should under all circumstance be resampled befor further analysis. Parameters provided by the TOM devices are listed in the following: epoch : machine readable time stamp based on the unix epoch in UTC [s]  runtime : time since last boot of the tom device [ms]  latitude : Degrees latitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due North]  longitude : Degrees longitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due East]  elevation : elevation above mean sea level [m]  rot\_\{x,y,z\} : Rotational acceleration around the three cartesian axis \{x,y,z\} of the TOM box. [degree / s{\textasciicircum}2]  acc\_\{x,y,z\} : linear acceleration in each of the three cartesian axis \{x,y,z\} in the reference system of the TOM box [m/s{\textasciicircum}2]  mag\_\{x,y,z\} : magnetic field strength in each of the local cartesian TOM box axis \{x,y,z\} [micro-Tesla]  roll : eulerian roll angle (angle around the x Axis of the tom box) [degree]  pitch : eulerian pitch angle (angle around the y Axis of the tom box) [degree]  yaw : eulerian yaw angle (angle around the z Axis of the tom box) [degree]  LIDAR wind data description A Leosphere WindCube LIDAR was mounted on the installation vessel Taillevent to record the atmospheric boundary layer during installation. The data recorded by the lidar was exported as csvs and provided by the vessel operator. The raw data includes the following parameters epoch : time stamp as a unix epoch in UTC [s] wind\_speed\_N : The wind speed at the N'th return level [m/s] wind\_dir\_N : Wind direction at the N'th return level in the vessels reference frame [degree] wind\_dir\_N\_corr : Wind direction at the N'th return level due North [degree due North] heigh\_N : The height of the lidar return level [m]  Data is resampled to a 1 s return interval.  wave data description Wave data was recorded using a waverider wave buoy (DWR-G). The wave rider buoy was located at 54 00' 238'' degree North and 6 26' 553'' degree East. In decimals: 54.0031096 North, 6.4425532 East. Based on the raw data, sea state statistics were derived with a return period of 30 minutes. The data comes as csv, column oriented text files. The first line entails parameter names and units and is commented out by a hashbang (unix commentary). The data is a combination of two different data files as provided by the buoy: {\textbackslash}*.HIS Data Text File (History of Spectrum parameters) and {\textbackslash}*.HIW Data Text File (History of Wave Statistics). This results in the two timestamps in the data file because history of wave statistics data is available immediately after each measurement time period, whereas history of spectrum parameters take approx. 5 minutes to calculate by the buoy and thus have a slightly later time stamp. For actual postprocessing purposes, a third timestamp rounded to full half hour is used. Parameters included in the data files are: epoch: number of seconds since 1st of January 1970 in UTC.

	abstract = {Single-blade installation is a method suitable for the installation of blades on large wind turbines. For single-blade installations on offshore monopile-type wind turbines, a jack-up vessel is often involved, and each blade is mated with the hub at the tower top. Prior to the alignment phase, the blade root and the nacelle at the tower top experience relative motions. The blade-root motions are induced by the wind loads, and the nacelle motions are due to the resonant vibrations of the monopile support structure under wave loading. To alleviate the relative motions and to facilitate the alignment process, external passive tuned mass dampers can be installed on the monopile support structures. This work investigates the application potential of tuned mass dampers in single-blade installation. Multibody simulations were conducted under collinear wind and waves conditions, and the relative motions between the blade-root and the hub were analysed. It was found that when an optimally tuned passive damper is considered for the monopile structure, the reduction in the critical motion radius can reach up to 30\%.},

	abstract = {During the commissioning and stand-still cycles of wind turbines, the rotor is often stopped or even locked leaving the rotor blades at a standstill. When the blades are at a standstill, angles of attack on the blades can be very high, and it is therefore possible that they experience vortex-induced vibrations. This experiment and analysis helps to explain the different regimes of flow at very high angles of attack, particularly on moderately twisted and tapered blades. A single blade was tested at two different flow velocities at a range of angles of attack with flow tuft visualization and hotwire measurements of the wake. Hotwire wake measurements were able to show the gradual inception and ending of certain flow regimes. The power spectral densities of these measurements were normalized in terms of Strouhal number based on the projected chord to show that certain wake features have a relatively constant Strouhal number. The shedding frequency appears then to be relatively independent of chord taper and twist. Vortex generators (VGs) were tested but were found to have little influence in this case. Gurney flaps were found to modify the wake geometry, stall onset angles, and in some cases the shedding frequency.},

Wind energy is one of the renewable energy resources. Considerable wind speed has made settling of wind turbines at sea beneficial and appealing. For this purpose, choosing the appropriate plates to set up wind turbines on the surface of sea is necessary. Regarding the installation condition, by choosing suitable geometry for floating breakwaters, offshore wind turbine can be mounted on them. Suitable geometry of breakwater for multifunctional usage could be selected with analyzing and comparing pressure, force and moment produced by incoming waves. In this article, the boundary element method is implemented to solve governing differential equations by assuming potential flow. On the other hand, for promoting free surface in each time step, the EulerLagrangian method is employed. Finally, to find the appropriate geometry for installing the wind turbine on the breakwater, moment and wave profile next to the right and left side of breakwater body are calculated. Among simulated geometries, breakwater with trapezoid geometry which its larger base is placed in the water has more sustainability and it is the most suitable geometry for wind turbine installation.},

	abstract = {One of the biggest cost drivers during the installation of offshore wind turbines is the single
blade assembly, which could be reduced by using a mass damper. Especially relevant
advantages that increase lucrativeness are: shorter assembly times, reduced waiting times
between the single blade installations and operations under comparably higher waves. Based
on measurements taken during the installation of an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, it
was possible to compare the installation times before and after the use of a mass damper.
Based on that, a cost model for the single blade installation was created. The results of the
analysis shows a cost reduction of up to 30 percent. Another significant point is the reduction
of the standard deviation of the installation times. However, the small number of measurements
taken represent challenges regarding accuracy. The results of the analysis indicate that the
use of a mass damper leads to a much more efficient installation, which makes the use of
offshore wind turbines notably more profitable.},

	abstract = {The offshore wind industry is building and planning new wind farms further offshore due to increasing demand on sustainable energy production and already occupied prime resource locations closer to shore. Costs of operation and maintenance, transport and installation of offshore wind turbines already contribute significantly to the cost of produced electricity and will continue to increase, due to moving further offshore, if the current techniques of predicting offshore wind farm accessibility are to stay the same. The majority of offshore operations are carried out by specialized ships that must be hired for the duration of the operation. Therefore, offshore wind farm accessibility and costs of offshore activities are primarily driven by the expected number of operational hours offshore and waiting times for weather windows, suitable for offshore operations. Having more reliable weather window estimates would result in better wind farm accessibility predictions and, as a consequence, potentially reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. This paper presents an updated methodology of weather window prediction that uses physical offshore vessel and equipment responses to establish the expected probabilities of operation failure, which, in turn, can be compared to maximum allowable probability of failure to obtain weather windows suitable for operation. Two case studies were performed to evaluate the feasibility of the improved methodology, and the results indicated that it produced consistent and improved results. In fact, the updated methodology predicts 57\% and 47\% more operational hours during the test period when compared to standard alpha-factor and the original methodologies.},

	abstract = {This study addresses numerical simulations of the lifting operation of a monopile for an offshore wind turbine with a focus on the lowering process. A numerical model of the coupled system of the monopile and vessel is established. The disturbed wave field near the vessel is investigated and observed to be affected by the diffraction and radiation of the vessel. The shielding effects of the vessel during the continuous lowering operation are accounted for in this study by developing an external Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that interacts with SIMO program in the time-domain simulations. The DLL is implemented by interpolating fluid kinematics between pre-defined wave points near the vessel. Based on the time-domain simulations, the critical responses, such as the motions of the monopile, the tensions in the lift wire and the contact forces in the gripper device in the disturbed wave fields, are compared with those in incident wave conditions. The results indicate that a great reduction in these extreme responses can be achieved when the shielding effects are considered. The sensitivity study of the responses in different wave directions is performed. The results indicate different behaviours with different wave directions and with short or long waves. A comparison of the responses when using a floating vessel and a jack-up vessel is also studied and can be used to support the choice of installation vessel type. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, with their increasing distance from the shore, greater water depths, and increasing sizes of the plants, the industry has to face the challenge to develop sustainable installation procedures. Important limiting factors for offshore wind farm installation are the weather conditions and installation strategies. In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of the most effective approach to installing offshore wind farms at sea, including the effects of weather conditions. This target is achieved through the implementation of a discrete-event simulation approach which includes the analysis of the environmental conditions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics, and assembly scenarios. The model maps the logistics chain in the offshore wind industry. A deterministic and a probabilistic metocean data method have been compared and cross validated. The results point to a good agreement between the two considered models, while highlighting the huge risks to the time and cost of the installation due to the stochastic nature of the weather. We suggest that simulations may improve and reduce these risks in the planning process of offshore wind farms.},

A crane winch servo motor is controlled by the NMPC controller. The direct multiple shooting approach is applied to solve the nonlinear programming problem. High-fidelity simulations of the lifting operations are implemented based on a turbulent wind field with the MarIn and CaSADi toolkit in MATLAB. By well-tuned weighting matrices, the NMPC controller is capable of preventing snap loads and axial peak tension, while ensuring efficient lifting operation. The performance is verified through a sensitivity study, compared with a typical PD controller.},

Rational-exponent Lyapunov functions (ReLFs) are employed in the backstepping design, and the Bernoulli inequality is primarily adopted in the stability proof. Semiglobal practical ﬁnite-time stability, or global asymptotically stability, is guaranteed by a continuous control law using a commonly used recursive backstepping-like approach. Unlike the inductive design of typical ﬁnite-time backstepping controllers, the proposed method has the advantage of reduced design complexity. The virtual control laws are designed by directly canceling the nonlinear terms in the derivative of the speciﬁc Lyapunov functions. The terms with exponents are transformed into linear forms as their bases. The stability proof is simpliﬁed by applying several inequalities in the ﬁnal proof, instead of in each step. Furthermore, the singularity problem no longer exists. The weakness of the concept of practical ﬁnite-time stability is discussed. The method can be applied to smoothly extend numerous design methodologies with asymptotic stability with a higher convergence rate near the equilibrium. Two numerical case studies are provided to present the performance of the proposed control.},

	abstract = {Offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have become increasingly popular for their ability to harvest clean offshore wind energy. Bottom-fixed foundations are the most used foundation type. Because of its large diameter, the foundation is sensitive to wave loads. For typical manually assisted blade-mating operations, the decision to perform the mating operation is based on the relative distance and velocity between the blade root center and the hub, and in accordance with the weather window. Hence, monitoring the hub real-time position and velocity is necessary, whether the blade installation is conducted manually or automatically. In this study, we design a hub motion estimation algorithm for the OWT with a bottom-fixed foundation using sensor fusion of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Two schemes are proposed based on a moving horizon estimator, a multirate Kalman filter, an online smoother, and a predictor. The moving horizon estimator mitigates the slow GNSS sampling rate relative to the hub dynamics. The multirate Kalman filter estimates the position, velocity, and accelerometer bias with a constant GNSS measurement delay. The online smoothing algorithm filters the delayed estimated trajectory to remove sudden step changes. The predictor compensates the delayed estimate, resulting in real-time monitoring. HAWC2 and MATLAB are used to verify the performance of the estimation algorithms, showing that a sufficiently accurate real-time position and velocity estimate with a high sampling rate is achieved. A sensitivity study compares the accuracy of different algorithms applied in various conditions. By combining both proposed algorithms, a sufficiently accurate estimation can be achieved for a wider scope of practical applications.},

	abstract = {One of the major concern of wind farm offshore is the type of wind turbine foundation to be installed. When it comes to talk about offshore installation of pre-piled fixed jacket foundations (3-4 legs), one of the most critical activities to be performed by the installer is the grouting operation. For currently wind turbines size, pre-piling jacket installation is a very extended alternative used which are drilled into the seabed until only 4-5 m come out the seabed line. Once piles have been installed into the seabed it comes the time to proceed with jacket legs installation. Next step is to grouting-secured together both structures (pile and jacket) pouring grout, throughout the already pre-installed grouting lines into the lower part of the jacket leg. Due to complexity of the overall manoeuvre as well as required precision not only for the grout system but for the right parameters should be considered for pouring in order to ensure the grout correctly into the pile/jacket annulus without segregation or other undesirable effects occurring a mockup test was carried out. The proposed and analysed method defines a protocol that could be used and repeated for others offshore windfarms that are planned to be installed in the future over pre-pilled foundations. Running a grout wall test based on protocol described on this paper prior to offshore grout operations will guarantee mix of grout and lub is in line with grouting foundations requirements, saving pumping grout time and therefore vessel stand by costs as well as money savings for grout exceeds, avoiding segregation problems could lead up to in worst case to foundations removal with massive vessel standby costs for reparation of the entire installation foundation operation.},

Guidelines and standards for health and safety in lifting operations exist; however, having people directly beneath the load is still common practice in offshore wind turbine installations. Concepts for human-free offshore lifting operations in the categories of guidance and control, connections, and assembly are studied in this work. This paper documents the process of applying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), using experts' opinions for the importance of defined criteria obtained by conducting an industry survey, to benchmark the suitability of the concepts at two stages. Stage one streamlined possible options and stage two ranked the remaining suite of options after further development. The survey results showed that criteria such as 'reduction of risk', 'handling improvement' and 'reliability of operation' were most important. The most viable options, weighted by industry opinion, to remove personnel from areas of high risk are: Boom Lock and tag lines, a camera system with mechanical guidance, and automated bolt installation/fastening for seafastening. The decision analysis framework developed can be applied to similar problems to inform choices subject to multiple criteria.},

This contribution presents the results of a monitoring campaign conducted during the installation of an offshore wind park in the North Sea. The campaign covered different states of the turbines: without rotor blades, with rotor blades, without supplementary damping system and with an installed, tuned mass damper system. The objective of the campaign was to determine the dynamic behaviour of the turbines in correlation with wind and wave data and to determine modal parameters. Accordingly, the turbines have been instrumented with sensors to record accelerations at three different positions. The modal parameters were then obtained using SSI/FDD algorithms. Structural damping is additionally determined with an RDM algorithm, and the results are being compared. The analysis of the data will be presented, including the different stages of the structural damping and the corresponding changes in movement patterns. The results shall be used to verify the load models and the predicted response of the structure.},

must be minimized. This can be achieved, among other things, by reducing
installation times. This work aims to establish correlations between prevailing
environmental conditions and rotor blade installation to subsequently make
predictions for future installation projects. Furthermore, it is investigated to what
extent the use of a vibration damper changes the installation frequency in a year. For
this purpose, worldwide data measurements from 2007-2017 are examined. Using
the programming language "R", time windows are filtered out that have installationfriendly wind speeds and wave heights. Finally, the filtered datasets are examined for
contiguous times that reflect the respective installation times required with and
without vibration dampeners. It can be shown that the use of a vibration damper
noticeably increases the number of possible installation windows. The probability of a
successful installation is lowest in January and highest in June. Filtering wave height
and wind speed reduce the number of installation windows. The elaboration offers
future work the opportunity to build on the results and use them further to make

The present paper proposes a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) to mitigate the tower and nacelle dynamic response in the fore-aft and side-side directions. An analytical model of the wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established wherein the interaction between the blades, the tower and the 3d-PTMD is modeled. Aerodynamic loading is computed using the Blade Element Momentum method where the Prandtls tip loss factor and the Glauert correction are considered. JONSWAP spectrum is adopted to generate wave data. Wave loading is computed using Morisons equation in collaboration with the strip theory. Via a numerical search approach, the design formula of the 3d-PTMD is obtained and examined on a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine model under misaligned wind, wave and seismic loading. Dual linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) deployed in the fore-aft and side-side directions are utilized for comparison. It is found that the 3d-PTMD with a mass ratio of 2\% can improve the mitigation of the root mean square and peak response by around 10\% when compared with the dual linear TMDs in controlling the bi-directional vibration of the offshore wind turbines under misaligned wind, wave and seismic loading.},

However, most of existing research in this field focused on unidirectional vibration mitigation, which is insufficient for research and real application. Based on the authors’ work (C. Sun and Jahangiri 2018), the present study uses a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3dPTMD) to mitigate the nacelle structural response in the fore-aft and side-side directions under wind, wave and near-fault ground motions. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established wherein the interaction between the blades and the tower is modelled.

Performance of the 3d-PTMD is examined on a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine under misaligned windwave and near-fault ground motions. The robustness of the mitigation performance of the 3d-PTMD under system variations is studied. Dual linear TMDs are used for comparison. Research results show that the 3d-PTMD responds more rapidly and provides better mitigation of the bi-directional response caused by misaligned wind, wave and near-fault ground motions. Under system variations, the 3d-PTMD is found to be more robust than the dual linear TMDs to overcome the detuning effect. Moreover, the 3dPTMD with a mass ratio of 2\% can mitigate the short-term fatigue damage of the offshore wind turbine tower by up to 90\%.},

Abstract Offshore wind farms will have larger capacities in the future than they do today. Thus, the costs that are associated with the installation of wind turbines and the connection of power grids will be much higher, thus the location of wind turbines and the design of internal cable connections will be even more important. A large wind farm comprises of hundreds of wind turbines. Modeling each using a complex model leads to long simulation timesespecially in transient response analyses. Therefore, in the future, simulations of power systems with a high wind power penetration must apply the equivalent wind-farm model to reduce the burden of calculation. This investigation examines significant issues around the optimal design of a modern offshore wind farm layout and its equivalent model. According to a review of the literature, the wake effect and its modeling, layout optimization technologies, cable connection design, and wind farm reliability, are significant issues in offshore wind farm design. This investigation will summarize these important issues and present a list of factors that strongly influence the design of an offshore wind farm.},

The results show that the one-step integrated transportation method can ensure stability of the wind turbine during the towing process. Reducing draft, increasing speed, and increasing wave height will reduce the towing stability of the wind turbine. In the practical towing process, the combination of various adverse situations will be avoided.},

	abstract = {Compared with jack-up crane vessels that are now widely used in offshore wind turbine installation, floating crane vessels are more flexible with respect to working water depth and are much faster in relocation. They are thus a promising alternative to install offshore wind turbine components, especially in intermediate and deep water. However, the wave-induced motions of the floating vessels make the operations challenging. This study deals with a preliminary feasibility study on offshore single blade installation using floating crane vessels. Two typical floating crane vessels are considered, i.e., a mono-hull vessel and a semi-submersible vessel. They are assumed to be equipped with dynamic positioning systems that can well mitigate the slowly varying horizontal motions. Their overall performance during the blade installation is numerically evaluated by comparing their performance against a typical jack-up crane vessel. The crane dynamics plays a less important role for blade installation by floating vessels, compared to the jack-up crane vessel. The floating vessels' wave-induced motion greatly affects the blade motion. The semi-submersible vessel causes a much smaller blade motion than the mono-hull vessel. The results indicate that it is feasible to install offshore wind turbine blades by using floating crane vessels provided that the vessel type is properly selected. From the operability point of view, semi-submersible vessels are more feasible than mono-hull vessels for offshore single blade installations.},

A jack-up crane vessel is subjected to wind and wave loads, which cause motion at crane tip. Excessive motion at crane tip can lead to failure of lifting operations. Therefore, the crane tip motion should be properly assessed for jack-up crane vessels. In this study, a fully coupled model is developed for a typical elevated jack-up crane vessel, considering the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads on the vessel, the soil-structure interaction, and the structural flexibility of the jack-up legs and crane. The vessel model developed is further coupled with the SIMO-Aero code to achieve a fully coupled aero-hydro-soil-elastic-mechanical code SIMO-RIFLEX-Aero for numerical modeling and dynamic analysis of offshore single blade installation using jack-up crane vessels. The SIMO-RIFLEX-Aero code is then applied to study the dynamic response of the DTU 10 MW wind turbine blade installed by a typical jack-up crane vessel under various wind and wave conditions. The results show that significant motion is induced at crane tip, mainly due to wave loads. It is important to consider the structural flexibility of the jack-up legs and crane when modeling the installation of offshore wind turbine blades.},

In time-domain analysis, two lifting phases are brought into focus, i.e., the lift-off and the lowering phases. For the lift-off phase, two scenarios are considered, i.e., lift-off from the own deck of the HLV and lift-off from a transport barge. Moreover, comparative studies using two types of installation vessels, a floating vessel and a Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process.

	abstract = {Current installation costs of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are high and profit margins in the offshore wind energy sector are low, it is thus necessary to develop installation methods that are more efficient and practical. This paper presents a numerical study (based on a global response analysis of marine operations) of a novel procedure for installing the tower and Rotor Nacelle Assemblies (RNAs) on bottom-fixed foundations of OWTs. The installation procedure is based on the inverted pendulum principle. A cargo barge is used to transport the OWT assembly in a horizontal position to the site, and a medium-size Heavy Lift Vessel (HLV) is then employed to lift and up-end the OWT assembly using a special upending frame. The main advantage of this novel procedure is that the need for a huge HLV (in terms of lifting height and capacity) is eliminated. This novel method requires that the cargo barge is in the leeward side of the HLV (which can be positioned with the best heading) during the entire installation. This is to benefit from shielding effects of the HLV on the motions of the cargo barge, so the foundations need to be installed with a specific heading based on wave direction statistics of the site and a typical installation season. Following a systematic approach based on numerical simulations of actual operations, potential critical installation activities, corresponding critical events, and limiting (response) parameters are identified. In addition, operational limits for some of the limiting parameters are established in terms of allowable limits of sea states. Following a preliminary assessment of these operational limits, the duration of the entire operation, the equipment used, and weather-and water depth-sensitivity, this novel procedure is demonstrated to be viable.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a methodology suitable for assessing the allowable sea states for installation of a transition piece (TP) onto a monopile (MP) foundation with focus on the docking operation is proposed. The TP installation procedure together with numerical analyses is used to identify critical and restricting events and their corresponding limiting parameters. For critical installation phases, existing numerical solutions based on frequency and time domain (TD) analyses of stationary processes are combined to quickly assess characteristic values of dynamic responses of limiting parameters for any given sea state. These results are compared against (nonlinear and nonstationary) time domain simulations of the actual docking operations. It is found that a critical event is the structural damage of the TP's bracket supports due to the potential large impact forces or velocities, and a restricting installation event (not critical) is the unsuccessful mating operation due to large horizontal motions of the TP bottom. By comparing characteristic values of dynamic responses with their allowable limits, the allowable sea states are established. Contact-impact problems are addressed in terms of assumed allowable impact velocities of the colliding objects. A possible automatic motion compensation system and human actions are not modeled. This methodology can also be used in connection with other mating operations such as float-over and topside installation. © 2017 by ASME},

	abstract = {Being one of the most commonly used offshore operations, offshore lifting operations become increasingly challenging due to the gradually growing size and weight of payloads. The research on automatic control in lifting operations, e.g., anti-swing control and heave compensation, only considers simple-shaped payloads, such as lumped-mass rigid points. However, the sizes and orientations of many structures cannot be neglected. To lift heavy and large-scale payloads, larger and higher cranes are required. Alternatively, it is possible to share the total loads by enhancing the number of lift wires that may limit the tension on each lift wire. However, the complicated configuration introduces significant complexity into the design of the automatic anti-swing algorithm, especially to the control allocation module. This paper performs a preliminary study on the anti-swing control of a complex-shaped suspended payload lift using a floating crane vessel and a large number of lift wires. Inspired by the knowledge of inverse dynamics and range-based localization, a general model-free anti-swing control scheme is proposed. The controller has a simple form without considering state–space equations, but it can reduce the pendular payload motion regardless of the detailed system configuration. An offshore wind turbine tower–nacelle–rotor preassembly installation using floating crane vessel is adopted as a case study to verify the performance of the proposed control strategy.},

	abstract = {The growing requirements of large-sized offshore wind turbines require heavier components to be lifted to large heights using installation vessels. This imposes a substantial risk of impact to the lifted components especially when floating crane vessels are used. Floating crane vessels are in general sensitive to wave-induced motion, causing substantial crane tip responses and can lead to significant damage to the lifted blades. Currently, the planning for such weather sensitive operation does not include explicitly the risk of contact/impact or damage in the components to determine the operational limits. This is important for wind turbine blades owing to the fact that they are made of composite materials and are vulnerable to damage from contact/impact loads. The present paper proposes a novel methodology to determine response based operational limit for the blade installation by considering impact loads. Structural damage criteria for the lifted blade under accidental loads are linked with global response analysis of the installation system under stochastic wind and wave loads. A case study is also presented where a wind turbine blade lifted horizontally using jack-up crane vessel impacts the pre-assembled turbine tower with its tip region while being installed under mean wind speed of 10 m/s. It is found that under such conditions, it is safe to install blade from structural damage perspective as the characteristic responses obtained were low to develop any damage in the blade. The findings of the study can be used to derive limiting sea states for blade installation using floating vessels, however a damage tolerance approach requiring residual strength analysis post impact is compulsory.},

Despite the stable foundation of the lifting cranes, the mating process exhibits substantial relative responses amidst blade root and hub. These relative motions are combined effects of wave-induced monopile motions and wind-induced blade root motions, which can cause impact loads at the blade root’s guide pin in the course of alignment procedure. Environmental parameters including the wind-wave misalignments play an important role for the safety of the installation tasks and govern the impact scenarios. The present study investigates the effects of wind-wave misalignments on the blade root mating process on a monopile-type offshore wind turbine. The dynamic responses including the impact velocities between root and hub in selected wind-wave misalignment conditions are investigated using multibody simulations. Furthermore, based on a finite element study, different impact-induced failure modes at the blade root for sideways and head-on impact scenarios, developed due to wind-wave misalignment conditions, are investigated. Finally, based on extreme value analyses of critical responses, safe domain for the mating task under different wind-wave misalignments is compared. The results show that although misaligned wind-wave conditions develop substantial relative motions between root and hub, aligned wind-wave conditions induce largest impact velocities and develop critical failure modes at a relatively low threshold velocity of impact.},

	abstract = {Single-blade installation is a conventional method for installing blades on monopile-type offshore wind turbines. A jack-up crane vessel is commonly used, and individual blades are lifted to the tower top height and mated with the hub. The relative motions between the hub and blade root during the mating phase, partly due to wind-induced blade motion and partly due to waveinduced monopile motion, can induce substantial impact forces at the blade root. This can cause severe damage at the blade root connections and have a high potential to jeopardise the installation task. Mitigation measures are therefore required to limit the relative motion between the hub and the root during the mating process. In this article, we investigate the effects of a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) on the (1) impact velocities manifested between the blade root and hub during the mating phase and (2) its effect on the response-based limiting sea states. Timedomain multi-body simulations of an installation system characterising the mating operation with and without a TMD for collinear and misaligned wind and wave conditions have been performed, and the effectiveness of TMD for controlling the impact velocity is quantified. Furthermore, finite element analyses are performed to determine the threshold velocity of impact for a scenario in which a blade root with a guide pin suffers a sideways impact with the hub. It is found that the tuned mass damper can reduce the relative impact velocities by more than 40\% and can sub­ stantially expand the allowable sea states and operability for the mating operation. Moreover, the effectiveness of TMD at reducing the impact velocity increases with increasing significant wave height (Hs); however, it decreases with increasing wind-wave misalignment and with shifts in the wave spectral peak period (Tp) away from the tuned frequency. The findings of the study can be utilised for planning safe and cost-efficient installation of latest-generation wind turbine blades.},

	abstract = {In an offshore environment, offshore wind energy resources are more available and stable, but the investment cost is much higher than that of onshore wind. The installation cost is a crucial factor of the investment. With the increasing number of planned and approved offshore wind farms, offshore wind turbine installation and relevant operations have received tremendous attention. Therefore, expediting the turbine-structure mating operations through a higher level of automation in offshore wind turbine installations may provide important economic benefits. To achieve a higher automation level and reduce the weather waiting time during the installation of offshore wind turbines, a flexible simulation-verification framework with high fidelity is needed. However, state-of-the-art wind turbine numerical analysis code is neither convenient nor open enough for applications concerning the design and verification of control algorithms. MATLAB/Simulink is among the most widely utilized numerical platforms by control engineers and researchers. This paper describes the development of a modularized blade installation simulation toolbox for the purpose of control design in MATLAB/Simulink. The toolbox can be used to simulate several blade installation configurations, both onshore and offshore. The paper presents the key features and equations of the different modules, exemplified by a single blade installation operation. Code-to-code verification results are presented and discussed with both quasi-steady wind and three-dimensional turbulent wind field.},

The purpose of this paper is to present a method for assessing the allowable sea states for the initial hammering process (shallow penetrations in the seabed) of a monopile (MP) using a heavy lift floating vessel (HLV) for use in the planning of the operation. This method combines the commonly used installation procedure and the time-domain simulations of the sequential installation activities. The purpose of the time-domain simulation is to quantitatively study the system dynamic responses to identify critical events that may jeopardize the installation and the corresponding limiting response parameters. Based on the allowable limits and the characteristic values of the limiting response parameters, a methodology to find the allowable sea states is proposed. Case studies are presented to show the application of the methodology. The numerical model of the dynamic HLV–MP system includes the coupling between HLV and MP via a gripper device, and soil–MP interaction at different MP penetration depths. It is found that the limiting parameters are the gripper force and the inclination of the MP. The systematic approach proposed herein is general and applies to other marine operations.},

Assessment of blade dynamic responses during installation needs advanced simulation tools which are limited at present. This paper alms at developing an integrated simulation tool SIMO-Aero for single blade installation for both onshore and offshore wind turbines. Based on the cross-flow principle, the aerodynamic model is established by accounting for the effect of wind turbulence and dynamic stall. Then it is coupled with SIMO to achieve the integrated simulation tool SIMO-Aero which can account for blade aerodynamics, vessel hydrodynamics and system mechanical couplings. The aerodynamic code is verified by code-to-code comparisons with HAWC2. Furthermore, SIMO-Aero is applied in case studies on the wind-induced dynamic responses of a DTU 10 MW blade during installation using a jack-up crane vessel which is assumed to be rigid, including the crane, and rigidly fixed to the seabed. The characteristics of system dynamic responses prior to mating the blade onto the hub are studied. It is shown that the blade motions are dominated by the pendulum motion. Critical parameters of the installation process are identified. The extreme responses of critical parameters are further studied under turbulent winds and wind gusts.},

This study focuses on assessment of the operational limits (in terms of Hs and Tp) considering the uncertainties associated with the sea state descriptions used in the numerical analysis. The aim is to demonstrate the effects of simultaneous description of wind sea and swell sea accounting for their different directional spreading and directions of propagation. A case study using lifting operation is chosen to address these uncertainties in the allowable sea states. To illustrate the results, two types of floating crane vessels, mono-hull and semi-submersible are employed in the case study. Operability analysis by using these vessels are performed and compared using NORA10 hindcast data for a site in the Barents Sea.},

This can lead to extensive project delays up to several months. The main objective of current logistical research activities is the robust design of planning and control methods for offshore installations. In this study, the basic conditions and existing disturbances of supply chains for offshore installations are analyzed. Based on these results, a planning and control concept will be introduced. Additionally, a mathematical model using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed.

	abstract = {Jack-up barges are commonly used for marine operations in the offshore oil and gas, and offshore wind industries. A critical phase within the marine operation activities is the positioning of the jack-up legs onto the seabed. During this process, large impact velocities and forces may arise from the barge’s heave, roll and pitch motions, and structural damage of the legs can occur. This paper numerically investigates the effect of a flopper stopper (FS) on the motion responses of a jack-up barge from the offshore wind industry. The FS is known as a passive roll compensation device. It is suspended from the side of the barge by means of wire ropes and cantilever beams. A simple geometry of an FS is proposed, and the working principle introduced. For the loading condition before the leg-soil impact occurs, global dynamic analyses of the coupled system are conducted. Characteristic values of impact velocities are used to establish the jack-up operational limits in terms of the significant wave height and peak period. By comparing the operational limits for the barge with and without FS, it is found that FS should be placed on the weather side. At beam seas, the current FS can lead to a maximum increase in the operational wave height limit of 35\%, whereas for the other wave headings, it may not be beneficial to use FS.},

	abstract = {Installation of Offshore Wind Turbine structural components need to be executed in sea states for which their dynamic responses are expected to remain within a safe domain or perform a limited number of outcrossings from the safe boundary beyond which the responses may lead to unsafe working conditions, large impact loads or even structural failure. A critical installation activity limiting the installation of a Transition Piece T P is often the motion monitoring phase of the mating points until its landing on the foundation. The operational limit is normally given by the horizontal displacement and the safe domain could conveniently be deﬁned by a circle of radius r in the horizontal plane. This paper presents an existing general accurate method and its solution to estimate the outcrossing rate of dynamic responses for a circular safe boundary in short crested seas which is applicable for the motion monitoring phase of offshore wind turbine components prior to mating. The required input is calculated from spectral analysis in the frequency domain and the solution is derived for Gaussian processes. It is found that both 1st and 2nd order responses have to be included and that the Gaussian assumption for the slow drift motions is not valid so that its real PDF is required. Also wave spreading has large inﬂuence in the outcrossing rate and should realistically be applied. The suggested approach is in agreement with real offshore practice, and is efﬁcient when compared with time domain simulations. Then, the outcrossing rate method could help on Marine Operations decision making during critical installation activities.},

To date, repair activities are often conducted using huge jack-up crane vessels and by applying a reverse installation procedure. Because of the high costs associated with installation and removal of offshore wind turbine components and the low profit margin of the offshore wind industry, alternative methods for installation and removal are needed. This paper introduces a novel concept for replacement or installation of offshore wind turbine blades. The concept involves a medium-sized jack-up crane vessel and a tower climbing mechanism. This mechanism provides a stable platform for clamping, lowering, and lifting of a blade. A case study of a 5-MW offshore wind turbine is shown, where common engineering practices were applied and numerical simulations of the marine operations were carried out using finite element and multibody simulation tools. Operational limits for wave and wind actions were established to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed concept.},

	abstract = {Weather conditions have a significant impact on the installation of offshore wind turbines. The rules for installation set clear limits. These limits are usually based on estimations of various experts and not on real assumptions and measurements on-site. When wind speeds and wave heights are too high, work cannot be carried out, and this leads to delays and additional costs. Therefore, we have carried out a measurement campaign during the installation of rotor blades to investigate to which extent the limits can be adjusted by using a tuned mass damper. The results from the measurement campaign—specifically empirically derived significant wave height limits—are used in a discrete event simulation. This study simulates delays resulting from weather conditions. Based on this, the total installation costs are considered. The results of the measurement campaign show that a safe installation with the use of a damper is possible at wave heights of up to 1.6 m. With the discrete event simulation, it is possible to prove that 17.9\% can be saved for the costs of the installation vessel. In addition, the wind farm could be erected 32 days faster. Thus, it can be stated that the use of a tuned mass damper simplifies the installation from a technical point of view and is economical.},

	abstract = {Access forecasting aims to predict the quality of transfer of maintenance technicians to/from vessels and the constituent offshore structures at the wind farm. This is highly dependent on sea state conditions as well as other environmental factors such as visibility. Typically, scheduling or dispatch decisions are made on the basis of deterministic forecasts of significant wave height, often coupled with service contracts where transfers are expected to be attempted below a threshold significant wave height. However, there is always uncertainty in a weather prediction which can be accounted for by probabilistic forecasts. The aim of this work is to explore visualisation ideas for transforming vessel specific access forecasts into an interpretable and intuitive decision-support tool. Three simple methods are proposed based on a score out of 10, classification of transfer conditions, and a threshold score. Methods for summarising access conditions for 2–5 days ahead are also developed. This new forecasting and visualisation capability has significant implications for marine coordinators and skippers who will be able to make better informed safety-critical decisions, with the potential for reductions in the cost-of-energy offshore.},

This paper describes a novel method for producing probabilistic forecasts of safety-critical access conditions during crew transfers. Methods of generating density forecasts of significant wave height and peak wave period are developed and evaluated. It is found that boosted semi-parametric models outperform those estimated via maximum likelihood, as well as a non-parametric approach. Scenario forecasts of sea-state variables are generated and used as inputs to a data-driven vessel motion model, based on telemetry recorded during 700 crew transfers. This enables the production of probabilistic access forecasts of vessel motion during crew transfer up to 5 days ahead. The above methodology is implemented on a case study at a wind farm off the east coast of the UK.},

	abstract = {Access forecasting for offshore wind farm operations is concerned with the prediction of conditions during transfer of personnel between offshore structures and vessels. Currently dispatch/scheduling decisions are typically made on the basis of single-valued forecasts of significant wave height from a numerical weather prediction model. The aim of this study is to move beyond the significant wave height metric using a data-driven methodology to estimate vessel motion during transfer. This is because turbine access is constrained by the behaviour of crew transfer vessels and the transition piece in the local wave climate. Using generalised additive models for location, scale, and shape, we map the relationship between measured vessel heave motion and measured wave conditions in terms of significant wave height, peak wave period, and peak wave direction. This is explored via a case study where measurements are collected via vessel telemetry and an on-site wave buoy during the construction phase of an east coast offshore wind farm in the UK. Different model formulations are explored and the best performing trained model, in terms of the Akaike Information Criterion, is defined. Operationally, this model is driven by temporal scenario forecasts of the input wave buoy measurements to estimate the vessel motion during transfer up to 5 days ahead.},

	abstract = {Installation of offshore wind turbines, particularly blades, is challenging and should be executed within the allowable limit of sea states to ensure the safety and the efficiency of installation. During the execution phase where weather forecast will be used in the decision-making process, uncertainty in weather forecast is an important issue required to be dealt with. The purpose of this paper is to assess allowable sea states for offshore blade installation, with emphasis on both considering weather forecast uncertainty and using time-domain numerical models for installation response analysis. The general procedure is presented, which includes generation of the response-based alpha-factor αR (that is a reduction indicator reflecting weather forecast uncertainty) in the planning phase based on time-domain modelling and analysis of blade installation, and assessment of corresponding allowable sea states in the execution phase. Single blade installation by a semi-submersible crane vessel at the North Sea center is studied in this paper, and two typical limiting response parameters, namely the blade root radial motion and velocity, are considered. The αR factors correspond to these two limiting parameters are first generated respectively, based on the forecast uncertainty quantification of sea states, the quantitative assessment of system dynamic responses and the estimation of their characteristic values through probabilistic analysis. The characteristic values of the responses that correspond to a certain exceedance probability (10−2 or 10−4) could be generated with and without the consideration of the weather forecast uncertainty. Finally, the allowable sea states with and without the weather forecast uncertainty are obtained when the characteristic value reaches the allowable response limit. These could be further used to identify overall workable weather windows for the offshore blade installation and support operation decision-making. Results indicate that there is a significant difference between the allowable sea states with and without considering weather forecast uncertainty. As the forecast lead time increases, the allowable sea states gradually decrease. Hence, it is necessary to apply αR to involve and quantify the effect of weather forecast uncertainties on operations. Moreover, since time-domain simulations are used for dynamic response analysis of the installation system, the effect of statistical uncertainty related to the use of a limited number of simulations to derive the characteristic response values is also investigated and is found small.},

The model is forced by validated ERA5 wind data, which shows better agreement with ICOADS observations than CCMPv2 and CFSR\&CFSv2. During the calibration process, we focused on wind input, whitecapping, and bottom friction terms and on whitecapping dissipation and bottom friction coefficients. Statistical error analysis of the calibration results demonstrates that the underestimation of significant wave height simulated with default settings has been corrected and the model performance has been improved in the study area. The assessment results revealed that construction efficiency has significant spatial and temporal variation characteristics. Annual and monthly averaged workloads of pile foundation construction and wind turbine installation are distinctly different since their specific weather restrictions and durations. Generally speaking, weather conditions from May to August are more favourable for offshore construction. In winter, offshore construction is strongly suggested to be stopped especially for sea areas of Fujian and Guangdong. For selected projects, the key environmental factors affecting offshore operation are different, which should be considered to improve construction efficiency and further decrease cost.},

The purpose of this paper is to present a method for assessing the allowable sea states for the initial hammering process (shallow penetrations in the seabed) of a monopile (MP) using a heavy lift floating vessel (HLV) for use in the planning of the operation. This method combines the commonly used installation procedure and the time-domain simulations of the sequential installation activities. The purpose of the time-domain simulation is to quantitatively study the system dynamic responses to identify critical events that may jeopardize the installation and the corresponding limiting response parameters. Based on the allowable limits and the characteristic values of the limiting response parameters, a methodology to find the allowable sea states is proposed. Case studies are presented to show the application of the methodology. The numerical model of the dynamic HLV–MP system includes the coupling between HLV and MP via a gripper device, and soil–MP interaction at different MP penetration depths. It is found that the limiting parameters are the gripper force and the inclination of the MP. The systematic approach proposed herein is general and applies to other marine operations.},

In particular, the installation of substructures requires attention due to their significant impact on capital expenditures and the limited literature and guidelines available. In this paper, we develop a decision support tool consisting of a discrete-event simulation that allows for comparing strategies for the installation of offshore wind turbine substructures in terms of time and costs. We identify several combinations of transportation and installation strategies for monopile and for jacket substructures. The differentiation is based on the deployed vessels and the installation sequence of the components. The strategies are applied to the case of a wind farm in the North Sea. For both substructure types, we find that strategies involving a second installation vessel result in the shortest installation times, and those in which the installation vessel(s) take(s) care of both transportation and installation result in the lowest costs. Additionally, we quantify the performance increases as a result of a reduction of the most prominent bottlenecks and the sensitivity of the project performance to the start date. Finally, the results are discussed in relation to future market and technological developments in the field.},

It was built as a demonstration project by the Swedish wind farm developer Vindkompaniet, the Danish wind turbine manufacturer Wind World and the British offshore construction company Seacore and partly funded under the EU-THERMIE program. Bockstigen is the fourth offshore wind farm world-wide. While at previous wind farms the main emphasis laid on the demonstration of the technical feasibility of offshore wind energy utilisation, Bockstigen was aimed at demonstrating its economic viability. A number of innovative concepts have been employed: Drilled monopile foundations were used to save costs. A new construction method has been applied making use of a jack-up barge. A new control system for the turbines and the whole wind farm was developed, which controls the maximum power output, the flicker and the reactive power consumption depending on online measurements of the actual grid state. These new developments have been implemented successfully. A substantial cost reduction compared to previous offshore projects could be achieved. (au)},

During the execution phase where weather forecast will be used in the decision-making process, uncertainty in weather forecast is an important issue required to be dealt with. The purpose of this paper is to assess allowable sea states for offshore blade installation, with emphasis on both considering weather forecast uncertainty and using time-domain nu­ merical models for installation response analysis. The general procedure is presented, which includes generation of the response-based alpha-factor αR (that is a reduction indicator reflecting weather forecast uncertainty) in the planning phase based on time-domain modelling and analysis of blade installation, and assessment of corre­ sponding allowable sea states in the execution phase. Single blade installation by a semi-submersible crane vessel at the North Sea center is studied in this paper, and two typical limiting response parameters, namely the blade root radial motion and velocity, are considered. The αR factors correspond to these two limiting parameters are first generated respectively, based on the forecast uncertainty quantification of sea states, the quantitative assessment of system dynamic responses and the estimation of their characteristic values through probabilistic analysis. The characteristic values of the responses that correspond to a certain exceedance probability (10− 2 or 10− 4) could be generated with and without the consideration of the weather forecast uncertainty. Finally, the allowable sea states with and without the weather forecast uncertainty are obtained when the characteristic value reaches the allowable response limit. These could be further used to identify overall workable weather windows for the offshore blade installation and support operation decision-making. Results indicate that there is a significant difference between the allowable sea states with and without considering weather forecast uncer­ tainty. As the forecast lead time increases, the allowable sea states gradually decrease. Hence, it is necessary to apply αR to involve and quantify the effect of weather forecast uncertainties on operations. Moreover, since timedomain simulations are used for dynamic response analysis of the installation system, the effect of statistical uncertainty related to the use of a limited number of simulations to derive the characteristic response values is also investigated and is found small.},
